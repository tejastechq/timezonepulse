Application Description: TimezonePulse

Core Purpose:
TimezonePulse is a web application designed to simplify the tracking, comparison, and conversion of time across multiple geographical locations, both on Earth and Mars. Its primary goal is to help users stay synchronized with different timezones, whether for coordinating international work schedules, planning travel, scheduling meetings, or simply staying connected with people around the globe (and beyond).

Usefulness & Key Earth Features:
The application addresses the common challenge of managing time differences by providing an intuitive and visually clear interface. Key features for Earth timezones include:

Multi-Timezone Display: Users can add and view the current time for multiple cities or timezones simultaneously, presented side-by-side for easy comparison.
Multiple View Modes: Time can be displayed in different formats to suit user preference:
Analog Clock View: Traditional clock faces for each selected timezone.
Digital Clock View: Clear digital readouts of the time.
List View: A compact list format showing times and offsets.
Effortless Scheduling: By visualizing multiple times at once, users can quickly identify suitable times for meetings or calls across different regions.
Smart Timezone Search: An easy-to-use search function allows users to find and add specific timezones by city or region name.
Customization: Users can manage their list of tracked timezones.
Mars Time Features:
A unique aspect of TimezonePulse is its integration of Martian time tracking:

Mars Location Tracking: Users can add specific locations on Mars to their list of tracked timezones, alongside Earth locations.
Mars Time Calculation: The application calculates the current local time at various Martian locations. This calculation accounts for:
The longer duration of a Martian day (Sol), which is approximately 24 hours, 39 minutes, and 35 seconds in Earth time (ratio: ~1.0275 Earth days).
The specific longitude of the location on Mars to determine the local time offset from the Martian prime meridian (Airy-0 crater).
Mars Coordinated Time (MTC): Mars time is displayed using the MTC standard, analogous to Earth's UTC. Offsets are shown relative to MTC (e.g., MTC+5).
Sol Tracking: The displayed Mars time includes the current "Sol" number, representing the number of Martian days that have passed since a reference event, specifically the landing of NASA's Perseverance rover (February 18, 2021). For example, a time might be shown as "3:45 PM MTC (Sol 1138)".
Defined Mars Locations: The application includes predefined Martian locations, encompassing:
Real Rover Landing Sites: Jezero Crater (Perseverance), Gale Crater (Curiosity), Elysium Planitia (InSight).
Fictional/Future Settlements: Potential future sites like "Olympus City" (near Olympus Mons) and "Marineris Colony" (near Valles Marineris), as well as a location at the prime meridian ("Airy Prime").
Rover Information: For locations associated with Mars rovers (like Jezero Crater), the application can store and potentially display details about the rover's mission and landing date (though the current code seems to have the roverPresent flag set to false for Jezero).
In essence, TimezonePulse aims to be a comprehensive tool for anyone needing to manage time across different locations, offering standard Earth timezone features enhanced with the novel capability of tracking time on Mars based on scientific principles and specific landing sites.
