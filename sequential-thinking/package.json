  "description": "A detailed tool for dynamic and reflective problem-solving through thoughts. This tool helps analyze problems through a flexible thinking process that can adapt and evolve. Each thought can build on, question, or revise previous insights as understanding deepens. When to use this tool: - Breaking down complex problems into steps - Planning and design with room for revision - Analysis that might need course correction - Problems where the full scope might not be clear initially - Problems that require a multi-step solution - Tasks that need to maintain context over multiple steps - Situations where irrelevant information needs to be filtered out Key features: - You can adjust total_thoughts up or down as you progress - You can question or revise previous thoughts - You can add more thoughts even after reaching what seemed like the end - You can express uncertainty and explore alternative approaches - Not every thought needs to build linearly - you can branch or backtrack - Generates a solution hypothesis - Verifies the hypothesis based on the Chain of Thought steps - Repeats the process until satisfied - Provides a correct answer Parameters explained: - thought: Your current thinking step, which can include: * Regular analytical steps * Revisions of previous thoughts * Questions about previous decisions * Realizations about needing more analysis * Changes in approach * Hypothesis generation * Hypothesis verification - next_thought_needed: True if you need more thinking, even if at what seemed like the end - thought_number: Current number in sequence (can go beyond initial total if needed) - total_thoughts: Current estimate of thoughts needed (can be adjusted up/down) - is_revision: A boolean indicating if this thought revises previous thinking - revises_thought: If is_revision is true, which thought number is being reconsidered - branch_from_thought: If branching, which thought number is the branching point - branch_id: Identifier for the current branch (if any) - needs_more_thoughts: If reaching end but realizing more thoughts needed You should: 1. Start with an initial estimate of needed thoughts, but be ready to adjust 2. Feel free to question or revise previous thoughts 3. Don&#39;t hesitate to add more thoughts if needed, even at the &#34;end&#34; 4. Express uncertainty when present 5. Mark thoughts that revise previous thinking or branch into new paths 6. Ignore information that is irrelevant to the current step 7. Generate a solution hypothesis when appropriate 8. Verify the hypothesis based on the Chain of Thought steps 9. Repeat the process until satisfied with the solution 10. Provide a single, ideally correct answer as the final output 11. Only set next_thought_needed to false when truly done and a satisfactory answer is reached",
