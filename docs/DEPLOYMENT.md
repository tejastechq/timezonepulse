## Prerequisites

Before proceeding with the deployment, ensure you have:

1. **GitHub Repository**: A GitHub repository containing the World Clock application code
2. **Vercel Account**: A Vercel account (https://vercel.com)
3. **Node.js**: Node.js version 18.17.0 or higher (as specified in package.json)
4. **Access Rights**: Administrator access to both GitHub repository and Vercel account
5. **Development Environment**: Local development environment where you can run tests and builds

## Environment Variables Management

Proper environment variable management is crucial for security and different deployment environments.

### Steps:

1. **Create environment-specific files**:
   ```bash
   # Create production-specific environment variables
   touch .env.production
   ```

2. **Move sensitive information to Vercel**:
   - Log in to the Vercel dashboard
   - Navigate to your project settings
   - Go to the "Environment Variables" section
   - Add all sensitive keys and tokens there instead of including them in your codebase

3. **Verify .gitignore**:
   - Ensure `.env*` files are included in `.gitignore` (already done in this project)
   - Double-check that no environment files are tracked by git

4. **Set up environment variable validation**:
   - Create a validation schema using Zod in `lib/env.ts`:

   ```typescript
   // lib/env.ts
   import { z } from 'zod';

   const envSchema = z.object({
     // Add all required environment variables here
     NODE_ENV: z.enum(['development', 'production', 'test']),
     // Add other variables as needed
   });

   export function validateEnv() {
     try {
       envSchema.parse(process.env);
       console.log('✅ Environment variables validated successfully');
     } catch (error) {
       console.error('❌ Invalid environment variables:', error);
       process.exit(1);
     }
   }
   ```

5. **Add environment validation to app startup**:
   - Call the validation function during app initialization

## Security Configuration

Enhance security by properly configuring headers, CORS, and implementing other security measures.

### Steps:

1. **Review and update Content Security Policy** in `next.config.js`:
   - Restrict script sources to trusted domains
   - Limit connections to required external services
   - Update CSP as needed for production:

   ```javascript
   // next.config.js (partial)
   // Ensure the Content-Security-Policy header is properly configured
   {
     key: 'Content-Security-Policy',
     value: "default-src 'self'; script-src 'self' 'unsafe-inline' https://vercel.com; style-src 'self' 'unsafe-inline'; img-src 'self' data: https:; font-src 'self' data:; connect-src 'self' https://vercel.com;",
   }
   ```

2. **Configure CORS for API routes**:
   - If your application has API routes, configure CORS to allow only specific origins:

   ```typescript
   // pages/api/[...] or app/api/[...]/route.ts
   export const corsHeaders = {
     'Access-Control-Allow-Origin': 'https://your-production-domain.com',
     'Access-Control-Allow-Methods': 'GET, POST, OPTIONS',
     'Access-Control-Allow-Headers': 'Content-Type, Authorization',
   };
   ```

3. **Implement rate limiting**:
   - For API routes that might be subject to abuse, implement rate limiting:

   ```javascript
   // Using middleware or in API routes
   import { rateLimit } from 'express-rate-limit';
   
   const limiter = rateLimit({
     windowMs: 15 * 60 * 1000, // 15 minutes
     max: 100, // limit each IP to 100 requests per windowMs
   });
   ```

4. **Scan codebase for hardcoded credentials**:
   ```bash
   # Search for potential credential patterns
   npx detect-secrets scan .
   # Or use grep
   grep -r "apiKey\|secret\|password\|token" --include="*.{js,ts,tsx,jsx}" .
   ```

5. **Enable security headers**:
   - Verify that security headers are properly configured in `next.config.js`
   - Ensure HSTS, X-Content-Type-Options, X-Frame-Options are set correctly

## Performance Optimization

Optimize the application for production deployment to ensure fast loading times and efficient resource usage.

### Steps:

1. **Analyze the build**:
   ```bash
   # Run build with bundle analyzer
   npm run build:analyze
   ```

2. **Optimize images**:
   - Ensure all images use the Next.js Image component
   - Verify proper sizes and formats are used
   - Check that proper image loading strategy is implemented

3. **Configure caching**:
   - Ensure static assets have appropriate caching headers in `next.config.js`:
   ```javascript
   // In next.config.js, verify this configuration exists
   async headers() {
     return [
       {
         source: '/:all*(svg|jpg|png|webp|avif|woff2|woff)',
         locale: false,
         headers: [
           {
             key: 'Cache-Control',
             value: 'public, max-age=31536000, immutable',
           },
         ],
       },
       // Other header configurations
     ];
   }
   ```

4. **Implement SWR and ISR strategies**:
   - For data that changes infrequently, use Incremental Static Regeneration
   - For client-side data fetching, implement SWR with proper caching strategies

5. **Verify code-splitting and lazy loading**:
   - Ensure large components or libraries are loaded dynamically
   - Use React.lazy and Suspense for component-level code splitting

6. **Enable Edge Functions for critical routes**:
   - Identify performance-critical routes
   - Configure them to use Edge runtime for global low latency:
   ```typescript
   // In app/api/time/route.ts
   export const runtime = 'edge';
   ```
