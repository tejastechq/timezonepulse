# PROJECT OVERVIEW

The World Clock is a sophisticated time management application designed to help users track and visualize time across multiple global timezones. It provides a robust solution for professionals who work with international teams, schedule global meetings, or need to coordinate activities across different time zones.

## Core Features

1. **Multi-Timezone Clock Display:** The application allows users to track time across multiple user-selected timezones simultaneously, providing real-time updates.

2. **Multiple View Options:**
   - **Analog Clocks View:** Displays traditional analog clock faces for each timezone
   - **Digital View:** Shows digital time representation for selected timezones
   - **List View:** Presents times in a scrollable list format, making it easy to compare times across zones

3. **Timezone Management:**
   - Add, remove, and organize multiple timezones
   - Smart timezone selection with search capabilities
   - Automatic detection of user's local timezone
   - DST (Daylight Saving Time) awareness and transition indicators

4. **Time Planning Tools:**
   - Meeting schedulers that account for business hours across regions
   - Ability to select and highlight specific times to visualize them across all selected timezones
   - Time slot generation for planning purposes

5. **Personal Notes and Reminders:**
   - Client reminders specific to timezones
   - Personal notes attachment to specific times/timezones
   - Notification system for important times

6. **Contextual Information:**
   - Business hours indication
   - DST transition alerts and information
   - Local holidays and observances

7. **User Experience Features:**
   - Responsive design for various devices
   - Customizable dashboard
   - Persistent settings via cookies

## Technical Capabilities

- **High Performance:** Optimized rendering using React best practices and Million.js
- **Time Precision:** Accurate time calculations accounting for DST and timezone peculiarities
- **Real-time Updates:** Live clock updates with efficient DOM operations
- **Memory Efficiency:** Smart component memoization and virtualized lists for handling large datasets
- **Accessibility:** Keyboard navigation support and screen reader compatibility
- **Offline Support:** Core functionality works without internet connection
- **Internationalization:** Multi-language support infrastructure

The application serves as a comprehensive solution for global time management, helping users visualize and plan activities across multiple timezones with accuracy and ease.

# ERROR FIXING PROCESS
- DO NOT JUMP TO CONCLUSIONS! Consider multiple possible causes before deciding.
- Explain the problem in plain English
- Make minimal necessary changes, changing as few lines of code as possible
- in case of strange errors, ask the user to perform a Perplexity web search to find the latest up-to-date information


# BUILDING PROCESS
- Verify each new feature works by telling the user how to test it
- DO NOT write complicated and confusing code. Opt for the simple & modular approach.
- when not sure what to do, tell the user to perform a web search

#CURRENT FILE STRUCTURE




# Fundamental Principles
- Test after every meaningful change
- Use clear, consistent naming
- Think thoroughly before coding. Write 2-3 reasoning paragraphs.
- ALWAYS write clean and modular code.
- use clear and easy-to-understand language. write in short sentences.


# Comments
- ALWAYS try to add more helpful and explanatory comments into our code
- NEVER delete old comments - unless they are obviously wrong / obsolete
- Include LOTS of explanatory comments in your code. ALWAYS write well-documented code.
- Document all changes and their reasoning IN THE COMMENTS YOU WRITE
- when writing comments, use clear and easy-to-understand language and write in short sentences.
