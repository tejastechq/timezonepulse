# Search Functionality Removal Summary

## Completed Tasks:

1. Removed the `TimeSearch` component import from both ListView and MobileV2ListView
2. Removed the `TimeSearch` component UI elements from both files
3. Removed the search handler functions from both components
4. Deleted the `TimeSearch.tsx` component file

## Next Steps:

1. Further code cleanup may be needed:
   - Remove references to search state variables in the component logic
   - Update the `TimezoneColumn` component to not use search-related properties
   - Refactor the `itemData` and `displaySlots` computations to not depend on search variables

2. Testing:
   - Verify that the application works correctly without the search functionality
   - Check for any UI issues resulting from the removal of the search box

3. Consider refactoring:
   - Simplify the code further by removing any remaining unused variables/functions
   - Potentially simplify the component structure now that search is no longer needed
