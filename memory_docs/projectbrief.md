## Project Scope
This project is a web application with a modular structure, including UI components, application logic, state management, utility libraries, and type definitions. It appears to be built with Next.js (or similar React-based framework), and includes support for theming, mobile, and performance features.

## Requirements (inferred)
- Provide a user interface for time-related or clock-based features
- Support for mobile and desktop layouts
- Theming and customization (e.g., background selector, theme toggle)
- State management for timezones or user preferences
- Static assets for branding and icons
- Modular, maintainable codebase

## Next Steps
- Deepen analysis of each directory and file
- Document specific features and flows
- Update as more information is discovered
