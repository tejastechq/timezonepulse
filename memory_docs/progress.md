### GitHub Setup and Git LFS Migration (Date: [Insert Current Date])

- **Objective**: Set up the Clock project on GitHub and resolve issues with large files exceeding GitHub's size limit.
- **Actions Taken**:
  - Removed the old NAS remote and set the GitHub repository (`https://github.com/lucidlayer/timezonepulse.git`) as the new origin.
  - Merged the `feature/improvement` branch into the `main` branch to bring it up to date.
  - Encountered a large file issue with `node_modules/@next/swc-win32-x64-msvc/next-swc.win32-x64-msvc.node` (141.60 MB), which exceeded GitHub's 100 MB limit.
  - Initialized Git LFS (Large File Storage) in the repository to handle the large file.
  - Tracked the large file with Git LFS and migrated the repository history to use LFS for this file.
  - Successfully force pushed the updated `main` branch to GitHub, with the large file handled by Git LFS (148 MB uploaded).
- **Outcome**: The project is now fully set up on GitHub with the large file issue resolved, allowing for continued development and collaboration.
