# System Patterns

timestamp: 2024-06-09T00:00:00Z

## Architecture
- Modular directory structure (components, app, store, lib, types)
- Likely uses Next.js or React for UI and routing
- State management via custom store (e.g., timezoneStore)
- Utility libraries for shared logic
- TypeScript for type safety

## Patterns (inferred)
- Component-based UI (React/Next.js)
- Separation of concerns (UI, state, utilities, types)
- Theming and customization (ThemeToggle, BackgroundSelector)
- Responsive/mobile-first design
- Static asset management (public/)

## To be updated as more patterns are discovered during analysis.
