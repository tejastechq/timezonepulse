## Current Focus
DevOps improvement to fix Git repository configuration. Removing node_modules from Git tracking to reduce repository size and improve performance.

## Recent Changes
- Identified and resolved issue with node_modules being tracked in Git
- Implemented correction by using `git rm -r --cached node_modules` and keeping node_modules in .gitignore
- Populated `techContext.md`, `projectbrief.md`, `productContext.md`, `systemPatterns.md`.
- Updated `progress.md` and `decisions.md`.
- Created `task_001_audit_cleanup.md` and updated `task_registry.md`.
- Completed dependency audit analysis (SUBTASK_001.1).
- Deferred NextUI/HeroUI migration to TASK_002 (#DEPS_001).
- Refactored layout: restored `app/components/Sidebar.tsx` as main layout wrapper in `app/layout.tsx`, removed unused floating sidebar (`components/layout/Sidebar.tsx`). Updated navigation and structure in `codeMap_root.md`.
- Finalized all Memory Bank indexes and completed project audit/cleanup phase.

## Active Decisions
- #DEVOPS_001 "Remove node_modules from Git tracking"
- Use Next.js 15 App Router as primary architecture.
- Support both Earth and Mars timezones.
- Integrate real-time data (weather, news).
- Modular, component-driven UI design.

## Immediate Priorities
- Verify Git configuration is correctly ignoring node_modules in future operations
- Plan and prioritize next major feature or improvement (e.g., UI migration, new integrations, performance enhancements).
- Create or update task registry and task breakdowns in `memory_docs/tasks/`.
- Expand/comprehensively document flow diagrams as needed.
- Continue maintaining decision history and rationale.
