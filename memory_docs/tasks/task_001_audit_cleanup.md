## Task Definition
Perform a comprehensive audit of the TimezonePulse codebase to identify and remove unused code, outdated dependencies, broken references, and inconsistencies resulting from mixed feature development. The goal is to improve maintainability, performance, and code health.

## Subtasks
1. ⏱️ SUBTASK_001.1: "Dependency Audit"
   - Goal: Identify unused, outdated, or redundant dependencies in `package.json`.
   - Required contexts: `package.json`, `pnpm-lock.yaml` (or `package-lock.json`), potentially search results for dependency usage.
   - Output: List of dependencies recommended for removal or update.
   - Dependencies: None

2. ⏱️ SUBTASK_001.2: "Code Structure Review"
   - Goal: Analyze the organization of `app/`, `components/`, `lib/` directories for logical consistency and potential refactoring opportunities.
   - Required contexts: `codeMap_root.md`, file structure listing.
   - Output: Recommendations for structural improvements or areas needing deeper component analysis.
   - Dependencies: None

3. ⏱️ SUBTASK_001.3: "Component Usage Analysis"
   - Goal: Identify potentially unused React components within `app/` and `components/`.
   - Required contexts: `codeMap_root.md`, source code files, search results for component imports/usage.
   - Output: List of components suspected to be unused.
   - Dependencies: SUBTASK_001.2

4. ⏱️ SUBTASK_001.4: "API Route Analysis"
   - Goal: Review API routes in `app/api/` for relevance, usage, and potential dead code.
   - Required contexts: `codeMap_root.md`, API route source files, search results for API fetch calls.
   - Output: List of API routes suspected to be unused or needing refactoring.
   - Dependencies: None

5. ⏱️ SUBTASK_001.5: "Utility Function Analysis"
   - Goal: Check `lib/` (utils, hooks) for unused or redundant functions/hooks.
   - Required contexts: `codeMap_root.md`, utility source files, search results for function/hook usage.
   - Output: List of utilities suspected to be unused.
   - Dependencies: None

6. ⏱️ SUBTASK_001.6: "Reference Checking"
   - Goal: Search the codebase for broken imports or references to non-existent variables, functions, components, or files.
   - Required contexts: Source code files, search results for common import/reference patterns.
   - Output: List of identified broken references and their locations.
   - Dependencies: SUBTASK_001.3, SUBTASK_001.4, SUBTASK_001.5

7. ⏱️ SUBTASK_001.7: "Configuration Review"
   - Goal: Examine configuration files (`next.config.*`, `tsconfig.json`, `tailwind.config.js`, etc.) for outdated or unnecessary settings.
   - Required contexts: Configuration files.
   - Output: Recommendations for configuration cleanup.
   - Dependencies: None

8. ⏱️ SUBTASK_001.8: "Cleanup Implementation"
   - Goal: Apply the approved cleanup actions based on the findings from subtasks 1-7.
   - Required contexts: Audit results from previous subtasks, source code files.
   - Output: Modified codebase with removals and refactoring applied.
   - Dependencies: SUBTASK_001.1, SUBTASK_001.3, SUBTASK_001.4, SUBTASK_001.5, SUBTASK_001.6, SUBTASK_001.7

## Generated Decisions
- Potential decisions regarding code removal, refactoring strategies, dependency updates.

## Integration Notes
- Subtasks 1-7 are primarily analysis and can be done in Plan mode.
- Subtask 8 (Implementation) requires Act mode and user approval for specific changes.
- Findings from earlier subtasks inform later ones (e.g., identifying unused components helps reference checking).
