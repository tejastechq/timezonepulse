# Project Cleanup Report (Generated on 4/5/2025)

## Potentially Unused or Obsolete Code

- **Deleted Components but Leftover Mentions:**
  - `AnalogClock` and `DigitalClock` components have been deleted, but some references or comments may still exist.
  - The `ViewContext` and `ViewProvider` have been removed, but double-check any dynamic imports or runtime references.

- **Test Files:**
  - `tests/analog-clock.test.tsx` was deleted, but ensure no test runners or configs still reference it.
  - `tests/README.md` had references to analog clock tests, which were removed.

- **Manifest Files:**
  - `app/manifest.ts` and `public/manifest.json` had references to screenshots of analog/digital views, which were removed.
  - Confirm no other PWA metadata or assets reference these views.

- **Old Standalone HTML:**
  - `index.html` was deleted. It was a simple digital clock unrelated to the Next.js app.

- **Store:**
  - `store/timezoneStore.ts` still defines a `ViewMode` type with only `'list'`. This may be redundant if view switching is no longer supported.
  - The store still contains some commented-out or removed properties related to Mars timezone explanations.

- **About Page:**
  - `app/about/page.tsx` contains the phrase:
    > "Switch between analog, digital, or list views to see time the way you prefer."
  - This is outdated and should be updated to reflect the current UI.

- **README.md:**
  - Mentions:
    > "Re-enable the List/Analog/Digital view switcher buttons in `components/clock/ViewSwitcher.tsx` after resolving the underlying issues."
  - The file `components/clock/ViewSwitcher.tsx` does not exist anymore.
  - This TODO is obsolete.

- **`components/clock/WorldClock.tsx`:**
  - Has a comment:
    > `import AnalogClock from './AnalogClock'; // Keep AnalogClock if used elsewhere, otherwise remove later`
  - The file `AnalogClock.tsx` was deleted, so this comment is outdated.

- **Audit Reports and Security Reports:**
  - `audit-report.md`, `security-report.md`, `search-removal-summary.md` contain many TODOs and checklists mentioning "remove", "cleanup", "refactor", "delete", "remediation", etc.
  - Review these files for any pending security or cleanup tasks.

- **Lighthouse Reports:**
  - Indicate large unused JavaScript and CSS bundles, suggesting potential for further code splitting or cleanup.
  - Legacy JavaScript polyfills are still included, which may be unnecessary.

- **Code Comments:**
  - Many files contain TODOs, FIXMEs, or comments about future refactoring, cleanup, or deprecated features.
  - Examples:
    - `public/total-cleanup.js` mentions "cleanup", "delete", "remove", "server-side cleanup".
    - `public/sw.js` mentions "delete old caches".
    - CSS files have TODOs about removing fallback media queries.

## Summary of Potential Cleanup Areas

- Remove or update outdated documentation and comments (README, about page, audit reports).
- Verify no runtime references to deleted components (AnalogClock, DigitalClock, ViewContext).
- Update or remove leftover type definitions (e.g., `ViewMode` in timezone store).
- Review PWA manifests and assets for obsolete screenshots or metadata.
- Consider further splitting or optimizing large JavaScript bundles.
- Audit for unused CSS and JavaScript as indicated by Lighthouse.
- Check for deprecated polyfills or legacy code.
- Review all TODOs, FIXMEs, and comments for relevance.
