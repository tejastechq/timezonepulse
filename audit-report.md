22# Unused Feature Audit Report (Main Page - /)

**Date:** 2025-04-05

**Objective:** Audit the main page (`/`) for unused or partially implemented features and remove dead code.

**Findings:**

1.  **Forced View:** The main page component (`app/page.tsx`) explicitly forces the `MobileV2ListView` by passing `forceMobileV2View={true}` to the `TimeZonePulse` (`components/clock/WorldClock.tsx`) component.
2.  **Unused Rendering Paths:** Due to the forced view, the conditional rendering logic within `WorldClock.tsx` for the standard desktop views (List, Analog, Digital) and the standard mobile view (using draggable cards) was never executed when rendering the main page.
3.  **Unused Components:** The following components were identified as unused in the context of the main page and confirmed to have no other usages (except `ListView` which is used elsewhere):
    *   `components/views/ClocksView.tsx`
    *   `components/views/DigitalView.tsx`
    *   `components/clock/ViewSwitcher.tsx` (Controls the unused desktop views)
    *   `components/mobile/DraggableTimezoneCard.tsx` (Part of the unused standard mobile view)
    *   `components/mobile/MobileTimezoneCard.tsx` (Used only by `DraggableTimezoneCard`)
4.  **Unused Backup Files:** The following backup files were identified:
    *   `components/views/ListView_backup.tsx`
    *   `components/clock/AnalogClock.tsx.bak`

**Actions Taken:**

1.  **Refactored `components/clock/WorldClock.tsx`:** Removed the conditional rendering logic for standard desktop and mobile views, associated state, props, and imports. Simplified the component to only render `MobileV2ListView`.
2.  **Updated `components/views/index.ts`:** Removed exports for `ClocksView` and `DigitalView`.
3.  **Deleted Files:** The following unused component and backup files were deleted:
    *   `components/views/ClocksView.tsx`
    *   `components/views/DigitalView.tsx`
    *   `components/clock/ViewSwitcher.tsx`
    *   `components/mobile/DraggableTimezoneCard.tsx`
    *   `components/mobile/MobileTimezoneCard.tsx`
    *   `components/views/ListView_backup.tsx`
    *   `components/clock/AnalogClock.tsx.bak`

**Result:**

The codebase related to the main page rendering has been simplified by removing dead code paths and unused components associated with deprecated view modes. This improves maintainability and reduces bundle size.
