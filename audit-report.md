# Clock Application Audit Report (Unused/Partial Features)

Date: 2025-04-05

This report details findings from an audit of the Clock application codebase to identify unused, partially implemented, or disabled features.

## Summary of Findings

The following areas were identified as potential candidates for removal or further investigation:



### 2. Outdated Documentation / Missing Features

*   **`components/clock/ViewSwitcher.tsx`**:
    *   `README.md` contains a TODO item mentioning this file and related functionality (List/Analog/Digital view switcher).
    *   The file `components/clock/ViewSwitcher.tsx` does **not** exist in the project.
    *   **Recommendation:** Update `README.md` to remove the outdated TODO item or investigate if the feature was intended to be implemented differently.

### 3. Active Features (Not for Removal)

*   **`components/dev/SettingsVerifier.tsx`**:
    *   Located within the `components/dev/` directory but is actively used on the `/settings` page (`app/settings/page.tsx`).
    *   **Recommendation:** Keep this component as it's part of the active settings functionality.
*   **`components/ui/SelectedTimeNotification.tsx`**:
    *   Actively used in `components/views/ListView.tsx` and `components/views/MobileV2ListView.tsx`.
    *   `Issues-to-fix.md` mentions desired UI refinements for this component.
    *   **Recommendation:** Keep this component. Address the refinement request in `Issues-to-fix.md` separately.

## Next Steps

1.  Review the recommendations in this report.
2.  Proceed with the removal of the identified unused directories and files.
3.  Update `middleware.ts` to remove the redirect for `/mobilev2`.
4.  Update `README.md` to remove the outdated TODO regarding `ViewSwitcher.tsx`.
